# Deep-Learning-Model-with-Clinical-Validation-for-Detecting-Ectopic-beats
Accurate identification of cardiac arrhythmias is crucial to ensure prompt intervention and appropriate treatment in cardiac care. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) patterns significantly enhances the timely detection of arrhythmias, including ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs). In this study, our objective was to develop and validate an AI-assisted approach for automated detection of ectopic beats, aiming to enhance performance for reliable clinical application using real-world ECG data and clinical expertise.
